# Vim Keyboard layout
 some apps like discord don't allow hjkl usage  
 as a keyboard addict i can't use these apps properly without them   
 so i made this layout  
# switching layouts
 to switch to the keyboard layouts
 ```sh 
 setxkbmap vim 
 setxkbmap us
 ```
before you go to quit the vim layout make a mapping to switch back to english when scrolllock is pressed 
i remaped the i key to scrollock for ease of switching back to normal layouts
